notes..

these should all be auto-generated at some point, probably by storing all the values in an rdbms (sqlite) and exporting them individually.
i haven't bothered to set that up yet so i just hard coded some basic things for now.
it's still wip so things will change :)

GearBases
--
all the available gear bases. _id should be used to reference the base itself and used internally.
implicit should reference the internal _id of an implicit mod (which should be declared in ModImplicit).
attributes should also reference an internal _id, though these are just the base attributes of a character.
tags indicate what mods this can roll (by default, anyway)

ModGear
--
all the available explicit mods for gear, including craftable/unique/whathaveyou. the key is the internal grouping id.
again, _id is the internal reference for the specific mod.
tooltip should probably be a format string of some sort...

ModImplicit
--
all the available implicit mods for gear, including craftable/corrupted/whatevers.
the key is the internal reference here, since implicits don't have any meaningful grouping.
in the case that an implicit is just an amalgamation of several mods, mods is an array; probably not going to be useful in the majority of cases though.
the attribute, similarly, references an internal _id, but unlike gear bases, these aren't limited to base attributes.

WeightKeys / WeightValues
__
two dictionaries that indicate what mods are available for each particular tag, and the weighting for each particular mod.
any given piece of gear should have a set of tags that identify what mods it can roll.
